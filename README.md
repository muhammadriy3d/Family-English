# Family: A Network for Freedom Of Speech & Expression

## What is Family?

Family is a social media application born from the mind of a young technology enthusiast who values privacy and security. In year 2017-2018. It sets itself apart by prioritizing the privacy of its users, a commitment that distinguishes it from other platforms.

## Who am I?

I am a young and creative programmer, a visionary entrepreneur, a tech-savvy coder, and a proud Arabian.

## My Goal

My primary mission is to ensure both freedom of speech and robust privacy protection.

## When did the idea begin?

The inception of this app dates back to 2018 when I was just starting my journey as a programmer. The driving force behind it was my desire to create a safe space for the Arabian community.

## How can you contribute and learn more?

I invite all programmers and well-intentioned individuals to join us in evolving and creating the best Arabian social media platform.
